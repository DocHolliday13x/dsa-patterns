# Coding Interview Prep

This repository will be my playground for practicing coding patterns to solve various DS/A problems. My goal is to first become familiar with the patterns and then to be able to solve problems using the patterns without having to reference the patterns. I will be using the following resources to help me achieve this goal:

- [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
