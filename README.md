# Coding Interview Prep

This repository will be my playground for practicing coding patterns to solve various DS/A problems. My goal is to first become familiar with the patterns and then to be able to solve problems using the patterns without having to reference them. I'll start using JavaScript, but maybe down the road I can attempt similar patterns using other coding languages. I will be using the following resources to help me achieve this goal:

- [Rhett's Forked Repo](https://github.com/rtrom/Several-Coding-Patterns-for-Solving-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Problems-during-Interviews)
- [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
